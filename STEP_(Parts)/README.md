# Which parts to print
**belt_purger-Mount**  
**belt_purger-Mount_closure**  
**belt_purger-Deflector**  
**velt_purger-Arm**  
**belt_purger-Pulley**  
**belt_purger-Idler_offseted** - Recommendedover regular idler, because it is designed to counteract nonperdencularity and flex of Arm  

# Alternative Parts
**belt_purger-Deflector_noinserts** - Designed with screw in plastic instead of inserts. Deflector is the most likely part to change with future development, so if you want to save your inserts, you can print this one instead.  
**belt_purger-Idler** - Basic version of idler. Designed under assumption, that arm is perfectly perpendicular to motor axis and that it does not flex. If you have any issue with offseted version, use this one instead
